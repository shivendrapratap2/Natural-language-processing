## Causal Realtion Extraction
A causal relation between two events exists if the occurrence of the first causes the other. The first event is called the cause and the second event is called the effect.
The automatic detection and extraction of Semantic Relations is a crucial step to improve the performance of several Natural Language Processing applications.
Our work is based on causal relation extraction from medical domain text.

## Causal Realtion Extraction
A causal relation between two events exists if the occurrence of the first causes the other. The first event is called the cause and the second event is called the effect.
The automatic detection and extraction of Semantic Relations is a crucial step to improve the performance of several Natural Language Processing applications.
Our work is based on causal relation extraction from medical domain text.

## Language Generation
This project is about a system consisting of a user interface and a deep neural network in the backend. The person with disability would select few images (whose names are keywords) and the model will try to predict what person wants to say.
